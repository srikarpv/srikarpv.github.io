Graduate Teaching Assistant, University of Central Florida:
Aug 2017 - Jan 2018
Worked with Professor Mike McAlpine and Assisted in building coursework and grading for COP-4600 Fall’17 (Operating Systems).
I designed programming assignments for a class of 175 students in Java and C sharp. Assisted students with assignments and understanding Operating System concepts.
Tools Used : Webcourses@UCF grading tool, excel.
Languages : JAVA , C#

Research Assistant, Institute for simulation and training (IST), University of Central Florida :
Nov 2017 - Jan 2018
I worked on user behaviour analysis in a social network for a DARPA funded project at IST under the Guidance of Dr.Wingyan Chung. My task was to collect data from the github api in json format, convert this data into a dataframe and store it in csv format. I worked on modelling and simulation of user- repository interactions such as fork, push, pull, commit, watch and delete operations. Used Repast Simphony tool in Java to build an Agent-Based Modelling system for simulation of interactions between agents.
Tools Used : Repast Simphony, Bash shell, R
Languages: Java, Python 3.5, Scala

Paper: Deep feature based on convolutional auto-encoder for compact semantic hashing. (Submitted for the ACM SIGGRAPH / Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation (SCA) ) 
Abstract - For content-based image retrieval, a good presentation is crucial. Nowadays, as deep learning models can be used to generate an excellent presentation, it has been extensively investigated and widely used in research systems and commercial production systems. However, the deep representation (deep feature) is still too large. Compared with directly using deep representation, binary code can reduce significant storage overhead. Meanwhile, bitwise operations for binary code can dramatically fasten the computation. There exist some schemes used to convert the deep feature to binary code, but all of them directly applied the last layer of the connection layers, which exhibit global feature and discriminating features. To achieve deep generative feature and avoid destroying the image locality, we aim to construct the binary hash code based on convolutional auto-encoders.

I was involved in designing the convolutional autoencoder train the given datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE), implementing a hashing algorithm to hash image features to binary hash codes, unsupervised learning of these codes using encoder-decoder network and again supervised learning of close codes using a restricted boltzmann machine(RBM) from the convolutional layers. For Image retrieval our model shows promising performance boosts over state of the art techniques such as LSH, ITQ, etc. Detailed comparison results are shown in the form of Graphs and tables (MaP scores).
